1. IMDB Data:
The core dataset contains 50,000 reviews split evenly into 25k train and 25k test sets. The overall distribution of labels is balanced (25k pos and 25k neg). In the labeled train/test sets, a negative review has a score <= 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score >= 7 out of 10. Thus reviews with more neutral ratings are not included in the train/test sets.

2. Twitter Data:
The Twitter Dataset contains 900,000 classified tweets split into 750k train and 150k test sets. The overall distribution of labels is balanced (450k pos and 450k neg).
